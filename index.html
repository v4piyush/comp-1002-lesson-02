        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Semantic HTML provides many benefits to people, devices, and software reading our HTML documents, and how
            they're able to comprehend them.</p>

        <h3>How to apply Semantic HTML to a document</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by pasting just the text of the content into the body of a new HTML document</li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the major components of your content</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Main Header</strong> - What is your heading content?</li>
                    <li><strong>Main</strong> - What is the main content?</li>
                    <li><strong>Aside</strong> - This may be optional, but do you have content that doesn't fit in the
                        main area, but is still relevant?</li>
                    <li><strong>Navigation</strong> - Do you have irrelevant content in your document that belong on
                        another page?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <p> Structural, semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.</p>
                <p> When a screen reader, or any sort of assistive device scans a web page, it gets information about
                    the Document Object Model (DOM), or the HTML structure of the page. No styles or JavaScript will be
                    read by a screen reader.</p>

        <h2>Structured HTML and Semantic HTML Fall Hand-in-Hand</h2>
        <p> Structured HTML is the practice of formatting the HTML in the correct order of intended digestion. This
            means, that the content is organized in the order it was expected to be read.</p>
